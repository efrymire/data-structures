#### Assignment Description

**Part One**

*Finalize an interface design for a web-based, interactive visual representation 
for the data generated by the two sensors you were assigned. You do not need to 
code/develop/complete this visual representation, but the documentation for its 
design should be specific, clear, and able to be fully realized based on your 
documentation.*

**Part Two**

*Submit a URL that returns real-time JSON from a query to your Postgres database. 
The returned data should be appropriate for the time of the query and map directly 
to the elements of the interface design you specified in Part One.*

#### Information Regarding This Submission

For this project, I recieved the [ir sensor](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_07/ir.md) 
and the [temperature sensor](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_07/temperature.md).

While both sensors worked well individually, the combination of both digital sensors 
would make the values of each "jump" significantly around the actual value. As a
result of this error, I continued with only the temperature sensor. 

I've changed my query to average the temperature per minute to reflect minute-by-minute changes. 
I would then create a 24 hour "clock" of temperatures, which I have created wireframes for below.
